## 1. Core Game Concept (Implementation Blueprint)

### Core Loop

* Survive wave
* Gain XP
* Level up → allocate stats or evolve class
* Harder wave spawns
* Repeat until death

**Score =** time survived + damage dealt + bosses killed

> Keep it simple at first. Scope creep kills prototypes.

## 2. MVP Implementation Plan
### Base Player Properties

```

### Shooting System

* Continuous auto-fire (Diep.io style)
* OR hold-to-fire (Galaga style)
* Use object pooling for bullets

### Movement

* WASD or Arrow Keys
* Clamp position inside screen bounds

---

## Enemy System

### Enemy Types

* Basic swarm enemy (Galaga-style dive)
* Tank enemy (high HP, slow)
* Sniper enemy (long-range projectile)
* Boss (patterned bullet hell)

## Wave System (Galaga Influence)

### Advanced Wave Types

* Formation waves
* Dive bomb waves
* Mini-boss every 5 waves
* Boss every 10 waves

---

## Upgrade System

### On Level Up

Player chooses between:

#### Stat Upgrades

* +Damage
* +Fire Rate
* +Bullet Speed
* +Max HP
* +Movement Speed

#### OR Class Evolution (Every 10 Levels)

Example Class Tree:

```
Base Ship
  → Rapid Gunner
  → Spread Cannon
  → Beam Destroyer
  → Drone Commander
```

Each evolution modifies:

* Fire pattern
* Projectile type
* Passive bonus

---

## 3. Combat Feel (Most Important)

If combat doesn’t feel good, the game fails.

Focus on:

* Screen shake on hit
* Enemy hit flash
* Clean projectile trails
* Clear damage feedback
* Increasing bullet density over time

Bullet patterns are where the Galaga influence shines.

### Example Boss Patterns

* Circular radial burst
* Spiral rotating stream
* Targeted sniper shots

---

## 4. Scaling Model

Avoid exponential difficulty spikes early.

### Use Linear Scaling For:

* Enemy HP
* Enemy spawn count

### Difficulty Modifiers

* After wave 15 → faster enemies
* After wave 25 → mixed attack patterns
* After wave 40 → bullet hell phase
